      French Croissants
    </h1>
    <p>  A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
        The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings.
        It may be flavored with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. 
        In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling. 
        In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese, or feta cheese and spinach.
         In the Levant, croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar.
         In Germany, croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye (Laugencroissant). In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the croissant is typically called a Gipfeli; 
        this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.
